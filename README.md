# Introduction
Multi-task topology optimization of photonic devices in low-dimensional Fourier domain via deep learning
This code present a method for the inverse design of nanophotonic devices which combine deep learning with topology optimization method. The 3D FDTD solver is used to guide the trianing of DNN.

If you use this tool in any published work, please cite <Mao, Simei, et al. "Multi-task topology optimization of photonic devices in low-dimensional Fourier domain via deep learning." Nanophotonics (2022).> and give a link to this repo. Thanks!


# Requirement
pytorch3.6 and above
lumerical FDTD solver
